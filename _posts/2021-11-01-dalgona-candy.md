## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp granulated sugar
- Pinch baking soda
- Cooking spray

## Method

1. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a ladle or in a very small skillet (preferably nonstick), add sugar. Place the ladle or skillet directly over a medium flame, and stir the sugar with a chopstick until it begins to melt, about 2 minutes.
3. Once all the sugar has melted and appears amber in color, immediately remove the ladle/skillet from the heat. Stir in baking soda until the mixture has aerated slightly and turned light brown.
4. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in 2 equal circles. Spray the flat side of a metal measuring cup or spatula with cooking spray, and press the candy to a Â¼ inch thickness.
5. Use a cookie cutter to create your desired shape. Let cool and serve.
