## Ingredients

- 200g cooking chocolate
- 4 eggs, separated
- 300ml Fresh Cream or whipped cream
- 2 tablespoons White Sugar

## Method

1. Break the chocolate into the top of a double-boiler. Stir over hot water in the bottom of the double-boiler until the chocolate has melted. Allow to cool slightly.
2. Stir in the egg yolks and beat until thick and smooth.
3. If you are using cream that is already whipped, skip this step. Whip the Fresh Cream and quickly fold the chocolate mixture into it.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add the White Sugar, beating until thick and glossy.
5. Fold half the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture, then add the rest, folding gently.
6. Pour into 4-6 individual coffee cups or one large dish. Chill until firm.
