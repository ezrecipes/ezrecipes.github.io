## Ingredients

- 1 cup White Sugar
- 100g Butter (melted)
- 3 eggs
- 3 bananas (mashed with a fork)
- ½ cup Fresh Low Fat Milk
- 1 tsp Baking Soda
- 150ml plain or fruit Yoghurt (apricot works well)
- 2 cups Standard Grade Flour
- 3 tsp Baking Powder

### Lemon Icing

375g Icing Sugar
1-2 Tbsp lemon juice
50g Butter (softened)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C conventional or 150ºC fan-forced. Grease a 21cm round springform tin (with high sides) and line base with baking paper.
2. Beat White Sugar, melted Butter and eggs until pale and creamy. Add the mashed bananas and beat well.
3. Heat the Fresh Low Fat Milk in the microwave until nearly boiling (approximately 1 minute). Mix in the Baking Soda then stir into the banana mixture.
4. Add the Yoghurt, Standard Grade Flour and Baking Powder. Mix well and pour into the prepared cake tin.
5. Bake for 50-60 minutes until the cake is cooked in the middle and just pulling away from the edges of the tin (insert a skewer into the centre and if it comes out clean it is cooked). Cool in tin for 5 minutes then release the sides and cool on a wire rack. When cold, swirl with icing.

### Lemon Icing
1. In a bowl mix the Chelsea Icing Sugar and lemon juice.
2. Add Tararua Butter and beat until light and fluffy. Add a little hot water for a softer consistency if required.
