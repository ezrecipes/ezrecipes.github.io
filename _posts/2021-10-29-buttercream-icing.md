## Ingredients

- 150g Butter (softened)
- 2 cups Icing Sugar
- 2-3 Tbsp hot water
- Â½-1 tsp of vanilla essence (or flavour of your choice)
- Food Colouring (optional)

## Method


1. Beat the Butter until smooth, pale and fluffy. Gradually add the Icing Sugar, half a cup at a time. 
2. Add the vanilla essence (or other flavoured essence and/or colouring of your choice), with enough of the hot water to make a creamy mixture, beating between each addition until fluffy.
3. Pipe onto cooled cupcakes or spread over a cooled cake.

## Tips
When adding food colouring add it a few drops at a time and make sure you mix it in otherwise you might end up with a brighter result than you desire.
