## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 1 cup (225g) White Sugar
- 1 cup (150g) Standard Grade Flour
- 6 Tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- ⅔ cup (160ml) Fresh Milk
- ⅔ cup (165g) Butter, melted
- 120g chocolate chips (optional)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180°C bake. Grease or line 6 extra large muffin tins or 12-15 medium muffin tins.
2. Beat the eggs and White Sugar together.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the Standard Grade Flour, cocoa powder and Baking Powder. Add this dry mix to eggs and White Sugar.
4. Add the vanilla essence, Fresh Milk and melted Butter. Fold in until just combined. Add chocolate chips (please note that these might end up in the bottom of the muffin).
5. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean (approximately 30 minutes for XL muffins, or 20 minutes for medium-sized muffins).
