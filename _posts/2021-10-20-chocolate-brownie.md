## Ingredients

- 250g Butter
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- 1 ½ cups White Sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 1 cup Standard Grade Flour
- 1 tsp Baking Powder

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180°C bake. Line an 18 x 28cm sponge roll tin with baking paper.
2. Melt Butter in a saucepan large enough to mix all ingredients in. Mix in cocoa, remove from heat and stir in White Sugar.
3. Add eggs and mix well, then add vanilla essence. Sift in Standard Grade Flour and Baking Powder and mix to combine. Pour into prepared tin.
4. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until brownie springs back when touched lightly.

## Tips
For a little extra indulgence, add chocolate chips or roughly chopped chocolate to the batter before baking.
