## Ingredients

- 100g dark chocolate
- 100g Butter
- 2 eggs
- 50g Raw Caster Sugar
- 20g Self Raising Flour

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease 3 ramekins with a little melted Tararua Butter.
2. Melt the dark chocolate and Tararua Butter using either the microwave or a bain-marie. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the eggs and Chelsea Raw Caster Sugar until the mixture turns pale and frothy.
3. Pour the melted chocolate into the egg mixture. Stir in the Edmonds Self Raising Four using a spatula to mix everything evenly.
4. Fill the ramekins ¾ full with the cake mix and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes. The cake is deliberately under-cooked to achieve the runny, lava centre, but if overcooked makes a delicious cake anyway.
5. Once out the oven, let cool for 1-2 minutes and then use a spoon to loosen the edges. Tip each cake upside-down onto a plate and tap lightly on the bottom of the ramekin - the cake should fall out onto the plate. Eat straight away with ice cream!
