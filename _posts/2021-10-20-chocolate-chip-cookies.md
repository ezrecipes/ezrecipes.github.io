## Ingredients

- 200g Butter
- 1 cup White Sugar
- 1 cup Soft Brown Sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla essence
- 3 cups Standard Grade Flour
- pinch of salt
- 1 tsp Baking Powder
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C bake and grease or line two large baking trays with baking paper.
2. Melt Butter, then add White Sugar and Soft Brown Sugar and cream these together. Beat in the eggs and vanilla then use a spoon or spatula to mix in the dry ingredients.
3. Roll into medium sized balls and place on prepared trays. They shouldn't spread too much so flatten slightly. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges.
4. Leave to cool on trays for a couple of minutes, before transferring to a wire cooling rack.

## Tips

You can easily halve this recipe. Alternatively, roll half into a log, wrap in cling film and freeze. Cut into 15 pieces while still frozen and bake (you may need to increase baking time slightly).
