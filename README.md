A food blog with easy recipes

# Contribute

To add a new recipe to ezrecipes, go to our GitHub repository, and fork it.


In your new fork of our repository, make a new file in the `_posts` folder called `year-month-day-food-name.md`.

Replace the `year`, `month`, `day`, and `food-name` with the day you are making the file and the recipe you are writing the food for.

You should end up with something similar to `2021-12-25-delicious-food.md`.

In that file, copy and paste the contents of [this file](./2021-delicious-food.md) into your file.

The text is mostly self explanatory, but here is how to edit the top.

```
---
layout: post
title:  "The same food shown in the title of the file"
date:   YYYY-MM-DD
prep:   Food preparation time
cook:   Food cook time
---
```
When you are done typing into your file, press the **Commit changes** button at the bottom.

After that, start a pull request.
